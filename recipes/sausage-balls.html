    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These 3-ingredient sausage balls are a real crowd pleaser, whether you serve them as a breakfast or brunch treat, a party appetizer, a game-day nibble, or a holiday hors d'oeuvre. Savory sausage, store-bought biscuit mix, and sharp Cheddar cheese team up for a yummy savory flavor that can't be beaten! My family makes these every Christmas morning.</p>
